# Project Requirements

With your team, you’ll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem. In creating your first collaborative full-stack application, you’ll combine a robust back end—with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication—to an intuitive front end. You'll continue to build on the agile development methodologies you’ve used throughout this course, like storing your project code in GitHub, managing your work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.

Instead of using the front end you developed for your first project, you should start from scratch. Doing so will help you reinforce your existing front-end abilities and solidify your understanding of the dynamic between the front end and back end. Also, you’ve likely improved your skills since that first project, so with a stronger foundation now you can build a better application, using all of the additional practice you’ve had in the last several weeks.

You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past eight weeks to create a full-stack application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge. Even more than your first group project, this project will provide you with an opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills, which employers will want to see when you begin to interview for development roles. Once again, the user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

- Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
- Use React for the front end.
- Use PostgreSQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
- Use at least two server-side APIs.
- Have a folder structure that follows the separation of concerns design principle.
- Include authentication using JWT.
- Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
- Be deployed using Render (with data).
- Have a polished UI.
- Be responsive.
- Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).
- Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).
- Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
