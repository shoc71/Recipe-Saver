## User Story
GIVEN I am hungry and do not want to order out
WHEN I want to cook dinner for myself
THEN I want an app to tell me what recipes I can make with my current pantry
WHEN I add ingredients to the site
THEN I want real-time updates to display recipes that respond to the updated ingredients list
